Software for Simulating An Affordable Muon Detector

## Overview
This is a collection of source files that can be used to create programs that simulate Muon detectors.
These range from simple C programs to calculate Muon detection rates in an "ideal" single detector using approximated integration of fluxes
to the sophisticated Monte-Carlo simulation of the detector elements with GEANT4.

The programs found here are used to evaluate the possible performance of an affordable detector system
for various investigations of cosmic Muon radiaton, naturally occuring on the surface of Earth.
The results will be summarized on a future report. A link to it will added once it is complete.

## Documentation
Is planned, but has to wait until all software packages are complete and fully tested.
